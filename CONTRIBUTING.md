# Contributing to Plenty V2
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development

### Running the interface locally

```bash
yarn install
```
```bash
yarn start
```

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request to `development`!
7. Make sure the PR has a description (It's important to provide as much useful information and a rationale for why you're making this pull request in the first place.)

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [GPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Plenty-DeFi/plenty-v2/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Plenty-DeFi/plenty-v2/issues/new); it's that easy!

## You can also report bugs using our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H4Xrv2uYrS)
You can track them in Notion

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* We use prettier for styling and eslint for linting
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
